# EggTimerApp

Boiling eggs or doing the laundry? Want to set a timer? Use the Egg Timer App and watch the egg break when the timer hits zero.

Egg Timer App is a funny little app that plays a short satisfying sound when the timer is done. The tone does not keep repeating because we do not want to annoy you.

Don't take my word for it. Try it yourself!
